## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.2]

-   Sync with cookiecutter-template update (version 0.4)
-   Bump required Python version to `3.10`
-   Allow data frames as design matrices
-   Allow matrices as input to LEMUR()

## [0.2.1]

-   Change example gene to one with clearer differential expression pattern
-   Remove error output in `align_harmony

## [0.2.0]

Major rewrite of the API. Instead of adding coefficients as custom fields
to the input `AnnData` object, the API now follows an object-oriented style
similar to scikit-learn or `SCVI`. This change was motivated by the feedback
during the submission to the `scverse` ecosystem.

### Changed

-   Instead of calling `fit = pylemur.tl.lemur(adata, ...)`, you now create a LEMUR model
    (`model = pylemur.tl.LEMUR(adata, ...)`) and subsequently call `model.fit()`, `model.align_with_harmony()`,
    and `model.predict()`.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-03-21

-   Initial beta release of `pyLemur`
